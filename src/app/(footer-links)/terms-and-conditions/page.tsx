                4. Winner Selection
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>4.1</strong> The Promoter may use different methods of
              choosing the winner, depending on the format of the competition:
            </p>
            <p>
              A) Main draw: All Entrants who correctly answer the Competition
              Question will be placed into a draw and the winner will be chosen
              by random draw. If no Competition Question is asked, all Entrants
              will be entered into the random draw. The random draw will take
              place as soon as reasonably possible and, in any event, within 7
              days of the Closing Date (“<strong>Draw Date</strong>“);
            </p>
            <p>
              B) Instant wins: All Entrants meeting the entry requirements will
              be randomly allocated an entry number on completion and payment of
              their entry. The Promoter will use a random number generator to
              select an entry number for any Entrants entering via the free
              entry route and meeting the entry requirements. If the entry
              number corresponds with the instant win number stated on the
              Website, the Entrant will win that prize;
            </p>
            <p>
              C) Auto draws: The Promoter may use an auto draw system for
              choosing the winner or winners of the Main draw and any Instant
              wins. For the Main draw, the system will be set to randomly select
              a winner from all valid entries as soon as the Closing Date is
              reached or all entries have been sold (including allocation of
              free entries), whichever is sooner. For Instant wins, the auto
              draw system will automatically allocate the relevant prize to a
              winner if their entry number matches the instant win number.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4.2</strong> All Entrants will have their names and entry
              numbers include on a spreadsheet which may be published on the
              Website and may be visible during the live draw. Names may also be
              posted on the website to indicate that an instant win prize has
              been won. If you do not wish to have your name included on this
              spreadsheet or posted on the website you must contact the Promoter
              via email at info@luckydaycompetitions.com as soon as reasonably
              possible after you have completed your entry and in any event, at
              least 48 hours before the live draw takes place.
